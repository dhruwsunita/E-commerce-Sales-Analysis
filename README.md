# Key Steps:
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled missing values, removed inconsistencies, and transformed data for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized customer behavior, product categories, and sales performance using matplotlib and seaborn.

- Actionable Insights: Provided data-driven recommendations to improve sales strategies and maximize revenue.

# Questions to answer:
- You need to calculate the monthly sales of the store and identify which month had the highest sales and which month had the lowest sales.
- You need to analyze sales based on product categories and determine which category has the lowest sales and which category has the highest sales.
- The sales analysis needs to be done based on sub-categories.
- You need to analyze the monthly profit from sales and determine which month had the highest profit.
- Analyze the profit by category and sub-category.
- Analyze the sales and profit by customer segment.
- Analyze the sales to profit ratio.

# Tools & Technologies:
